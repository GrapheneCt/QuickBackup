QuickBackup is a tool to trigger automatic savedata backup feature on PS Vita.
Savedata backups are created for the last 5 games that you played and stored in ux0:/user/xx/savedata_backup

To restore savedata backup for the game, open ux0:/user/xx/savedata/TITLEID/sce_sys and delete sdslot.dat. After that simply launch the game.
